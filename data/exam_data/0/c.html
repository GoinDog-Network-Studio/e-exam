    <p>Should we use AI at schools? Some people say no. But many experts think we should use it well. AI can help us
        learn better.</p>
    <p>Zheng Qinghua from Tongji University says using AI at schools is important. He thinks AI helps us learn new
        things and do better in study. In fact, AI is also getting more and more popular for teaching. Zheng says we can
        use models such as Ernie Bot, an AI chatbot(聊天机器人). It can write papers, solve science problems and do homework.

    <p>An online survey shows 89% of students use AI for homework. But some worry it
        may bring problems like academic integrity(学术诚信) and bad influence on education. “We shouldn't just
        use
    <span style="font-weight: bold; text-indent: 0; text-decoration: underline;">it</span>
    for answers or homework. We should use it to help students be creative and
        solve real-life problems.” Zheng says.</p>
    <p>Colin Bailey from Queen Mary University of London says that ChatGPT develops fast, stopping AI from being used at
        schools is impossible. Instead, we should think about how to use it in a right way.</p>
    <p>To make it come true, people around the world are working on rules to make sure AI is used in a good way. China
        has also done something for AI service.</p>
