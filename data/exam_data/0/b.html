<p>Last Summer, I camped in the mountains with my parents. I saw a beautiful yellow butterfly while my parents were cooking dinner next to the tent. I followed it and wanted to catch it. After I walked for a long time, I found I got lost. I felt very nervous, so I began to run back quickly. Suddenly, I fell over.</p>
<p>“What should I do?” I cried. When I looked around, I saw a man and a dog walking towards me.</p>
<p>“Your mom and dad called Search and Rescue(搜救队) for help, because they couldn't find you anywhere. Are you feeling well?” the man asked.</p>
<p>“Oh, no, my left foot hurts and I can't walk.”</p>
<p style="float: left;">“Don't worry. I will call 120. The&nbsp;<p style="float: left;text-indent: 0;text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">ambulance</p>&nbsp;will arrive here soon.” said the man.</p>
<p>“How did you find me?” I asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“I let my dog Bella smell your jacket. She followed your smell and found you.” he said</p>
<p>The ambulance arrived and took me to the hospital. When we got to the hospital, mom and dad were waiting there. I had an X-ray of my left foot. Luckily, it wasn't broken. But I needed to stay in bed for several days. Mom and dad thanked everyone who helped me. And we thanked Bella, too.</p>
