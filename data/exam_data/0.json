We had to rush to the restroom, drink water quickly, and we had no time to do sports. But recently, our school made a great change in the class break. It is longer, from 10 to 15 minutes. The 15-minute break has truly made a difference to our life.\nDuring the 15-minute break, we can do different activities. Some students play ball games on the playground, enjoying the fresh air and physical exercise. Others choose to stay in the classroom, sharing interesting stories or discussing problems they met in study. Some students also use this time to review(复习) the knowledge learned in the last class.\nThe longer break not only makes us feel relaxed but also improves ourselves. We are more energetic(精力充沛的) for the next class after a good rest. Besides, we can make more friends and learn from each other. The 15-minute break lets us have deeper conversations and build stronger relationships with our classmates. This change has truly made our school days more enjoyable and meaningful."
